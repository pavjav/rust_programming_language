Once you have a token from crates.io

cargo login TOKEN

will allow you to publish a crate via 

cargo publish

Just make sure that the Cargo.toml is updated with the next version and does not conflict with any other crate
Also make sure your license is supplied.

In order to deprecate a bad version of your crate use 

cargo yank --vers 1.0.1
to deprecate it

and cargo yank --vers 1.0.1 --undo
to undo that action

Deprecating will make it so any dependencies on your crate breaks and it encourages a developer to use a newer version
